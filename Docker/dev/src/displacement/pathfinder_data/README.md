# Node grid generation for A* algorithm

## Use of *nodegrid_creator.py* for dense grids

If you want automatic grid generation, with equally reparted point in the grid, it's better to use *nodegrid_creator.py*. It allows huge grids with thousands of node/points

## More precise / less points grid

You have 2 options (or more idk...):
* Edit the *.xml* file yourself and add the points + relations you want. It can be useful if you want maps with not so much point (<50) and at precise coordinates **[hard and painful option]** 
* Use *nodegrid_creator.py* but with a predefined set of node at the coordinates you want (as a *dict* or *list* or *set*) **[much easier option xD]**. 
/!\ It can be hard to get correct connection with this method...
